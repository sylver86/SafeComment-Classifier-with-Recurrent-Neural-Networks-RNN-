## Overview

The SafeComment Classifier with RNN project is my initiative to create a safer and more respectful online environment by identifying and filtering potentially harmful comments. Leveraging the sequential data processing capabilities of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), this advanced Deep Learning model efficiently processes and analyzes user comments in real time. My choice of RNN is driven by its proficiency in handling sequences and its ability to maintain context over long sequences of text, making it particularly suitable for dynamic text analysis where understanding the context and flow of language is crucial.

## Understanding Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are a class of neural networks that excel in processing sequences of data. They are distinguished by their "memory" as they retain information from previous inputs to influence the current input's processing. RNNs are structured with loops within neurons that allow information to persist.

In the context of this project, the RNN analyzes each word of a user's comment while retaining context from previous words. This capability makes RNNs ideal for tasks where context is critical, such as sentiment analysis, language modeling, and, in my case, detecting harmful comments.

### How RNNs Function in the SafeComment Classifier

In the SafeComment Classifier, the RNN processes each comment by breaking it down into sequences of words or characters. As it reads each sequence, the RNN maintains a form of “state” or memory that holds information about all the previous words it has seen in the comment.

This ongoing stream of input allows the RNN to consider the entire context of a comment, enabling it to detect subtle nuances of language that could indicate harmfulness. For instance, the RNN can differentiate between genuinely harmful comments and those that might contain potentially sensitive words in a non-harmful context.

## Key Features

1. **Text Preprocessing**
   My text preprocessing pipeline employs advanced techniques to remove non-significant tokens, enhancing the clarity and focus of the input data, thus improving the RNN's ability to classify text based on semantic content accurately.

2. **Sequence Transformation**
   Once preprocessed, text data is transformed into sequences. This step is vital for preparing the input for the RNN, which thrives on sequential input and can capture the dynamic and semantic relationships within the textual corpus more effectively.

3. **Recurrent Neural Network Model**
   I utilize a sophisticated RNN model featuring recurrent layers, optimized for multi-label classification tasks. These layers are particularly adept at interpreting complex language nuances and maintaining context across sentences, which is essential for assessing the various dimensions of comment harmfulness.

4. **Real-Time Classification**
   The RNN evaluates comments in real time, outputting a classification vector where each entry corresponds to a specific category of harmfulness. A comment is deemed non-harmful if the vector contains all zeros [0,0,0,0,0,0], indicating no harmful content according to the predefined categories.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project encompasses a wide range of comments, from explicitly negative to neutral or entirely devoid of harmful elements. Each comment in the dataset is labeled with a '1' or '0' across multiple categories of harmfulness, which correspond to different types of injurious content (e.g., toxic, obscene, threatening, etc.). Additionally, the dataset features a 'sum_injurious' column, which aggregates the harmfulness ratings across categories for each comment, providing a comprehensive view of the overall negativity expressed.
