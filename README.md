# SafeComment Classifier with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

🎯 **Objective:** Develop a safer and more respectful online environment by identifying and filtering potentially harmful comments using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). This project leverages advanced Deep Learning to analyze and classify user comments in real-time based on their potential harmfulness.

## Key Achievements

🔍 **Data Mastery:**
  - Employed a complex dataset encompassing a wide range of comments from explicitly negative to completely non-harmful.
  - Utilized multi-label classification to assess different dimensions of harmfulness, such as toxic, obscene, and threatening language.

🌟 **Challenging Task Conquered:**
  - Effectively trained an RNN to understand and interpret nuanced language within user comments.
  - Enhanced real-time classification capabilities to ensure immediate content moderation.

💡 **Innovative Approaches:**
  - Integrated advanced text preprocessing techniques to refine input data for the RNN, improving semantic understanding.
  - Developed a sequence transformation strategy to optimize data structure for sequential learning in the RNN.

## Your Experience Journey

📊 **Key Dataset Properties:**
  - Wide-ranging comment types, from negative to neutral.
  - Labels indicating the presence of harmful content across multiple categories.
  - A 'sum_injurious' column aggregating harmfulness ratings to provide a comprehensive negativity overview.

🔮 **Your Impact:**
  - Directly contributed to creating a safer online space by filtering out harmful content effectively.
  - Advanced the field of text-based classification using RNNs, setting a benchmark for real-time content moderation technology.
